## Samples description
Fluorescent micropscopy data. iPSC-derived astrocytes were cultured in 96-well plates for 21 days and fluorecent images were taken after 0, 1, 7, 14 and 21 days in culture. The cells were treated with the following three different treatment (except at day 0 where all wells are expected to be the same) were : 

1. **No treatment**: D1-D7.
1. **CNTF treatment**: A1-A7.
1. **BMP4 treatment**: B1-B7. 
1. **CNTF+BMP4 treatment**: C1-C7

Half of the astrocytes were transfected with a GFP under the CMV promoter which provides the highest expression activity in the broadest range of cell types. Only half of the plated cells contain the GFP in order to be able to detect cells. 

## Analysis and results
The analysis is presented in the [preprocessing analysis](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/RLuisier/AxonLoc/blob/main/1_overview_data.html) that relates to  Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1.
